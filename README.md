# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Loan Defaulter Segmentation

This repository contains the code and analysis for an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project focused on loan defaulter segmentation. The project aims to analyze a dataset related to loan applicants and perform comprehensive EDA to understand patterns and characteristics that may influence loan default.

## Project Overview

In this project, we explore a dataset containing various attributes of loan applicants, such as demographic information, credit history, loan details, and employment status. The primary objectives include:

- Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset to ensure data quality.
- Performing statistical analysis and visualization to uncover insights.
- Segmenting borrowers based on their risk of defaulting on loans using clustering techniques.
- Deriving actionable insights to optimize lending practices and mitigate default risk.
